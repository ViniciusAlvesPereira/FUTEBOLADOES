## Release 0.1
This release contains new updates that are listed below:

* UI Updates

* SegFault fixes
	* The latest code release has some seriously bugs in certain modules, like the coach and the player. They are now working properly and may not have any problems (except the timeroverextended problems, that will be checked in the next release).
